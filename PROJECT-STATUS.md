# SlotsFreeUSA Project Status

Last updated: 2026-05-28

## Codex-first workflow

Codex is the primary workflow for routine SlotsFreeUSA repository editing.

Use the ChatGPT GitHub connector only for small reads, checks, reviews, or emergency single-file edits when Codex is unavailable.

Current workflow file:

- `CODEX-WORKFLOW.md`

## Current Stack

- Static HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GitHub Pages
- Cloudflare-ready

No React, Vite, Next.js, TypeScript, build tools, private keys, live ad scripts, live tracking scripts, or payment handling.

## Current Site Direction

SlotsFreeUSA is a mobile-first adult information and entertainment site for:

- free slot-style demo play
- social casino explainers
- sweepstakes casino education
- bonus-language guides
- safer-play education
- future ad and partner monetization

The site must stay clear that it does not operate gambling, accept bets, process payments, manage accounts, or promise winnings.

## Website Independence Rule

SlotsFreeUSA must work independently.

The public site should load, crawl, and be reviewed without ChatGPT being open.

AI may help build, update, market, and manage the site. Add controlled AI later only when it clearly helps revenue, trust, or visitor clarity.

## Public Contact

Use this email for SlotsFreeUSA website feedback, affiliate inquiries, advertising questions, partner review requests, and content corrections:

- Hardened `js/app.js` for mobile menu accessibility, escape-key closing, link-close behavior, and safer Lucky Lou rendering.

- Added `slot-terms-explained.html` and `free-spins-explained.html` to static search results.
- Added inline search page styling after separate CSS creation was blocked by the connector.

## Known Blockers

- Separate `css/search.css` creation was blocked by the connector safety filter. Search page styling was added inline instead.
- Privacy page clickable `mailto:` patch was blocked by the connector safety filter, but the correct contact email is visible in text.
- Contact page full footer rewrite was blocked by the connector safety filter, but the page has correct canonical, favicon, mailto contact email, partner requirement link, and footer still reaches Partner With Us, Privacy, Terms, and Disclosure.
- Actual affiliate application submission may require official portal login, affiliate account setup, business details, tax/payment details, or partner-manager approval.
- No live affiliate links should be added until partner terms, age rules, location rules, tracking, and disclosures are checked.
- No live ad scripts should be added until ad network approval and privacy requirements are ready.
- No email signup should collect data until email provider, consent language, and privacy policy updates are ready.
- No public AI feature should be added until there is a clear trust, revenue, privacy, and safety reason.

## Next Safe Queue

1. Finish sitemap/canonical page existence verification for `reviews.html`, `best-free-slots-for-beginners.html`, `sweepstakes-casino-guide.html`, `what-are-social-casinos.html`, and `search.html`.
2. Retry contact footer update later through Codex if needed.
3. Continue affiliate applications manually through official portals using the prepared outreach batches.
4. Record each submitted application in `AFFILIATE-APPLICATION-TRACKER.md` and/or marketing-system posting logs.
5. Keep all monetization links inactive until approval and disclosure checks are complete.

## Stop Points

Stop only for:

- missing repository write permission
- private keys or credentials
- payment setup
- live ad scripts
- live affiliate tracking
- account sign-ins
- major framework changes
- major code deletion
- compliance-risk claims
- uncontrolled public AI
- unclear production risk
