# SlotsFreeUSA Project Status

Last updated: 2026-05-28

## Current Stack

- Static HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GitHub Pages source control
- Cloudflare-ready hosting target

No React, Vite, Next.js, TypeScript, build tools, private keys, live ad scripts, live tracking scripts, payment handling, uncontrolled public AI, or live affiliate links.

## Website Independence Rule

SlotsFreeUSA must work independently. The public site should load, crawl, and be reviewed without ChatGPT being open.

GitHub owns the code. Cloudflare or GitHub Pages hosts the public site. Visitors, Google, partners, and affiliates should be able to review the website directly.

## Public Contact

Use this email for website feedback, affiliate inquiries, advertising questions, partner review requests, and content corrections:

`slotsfreeusa@gmail.com`

## What The Site Does

SlotsFreeUSA is a mobile-first adult information and entertainment site for free slot-style demo play, no-download slot guides, social casino explainers, sweepstakes casino education, bonus-language guides, safer-play education, and future ad or partner monetization after approval.

The site must stay clear that it does not operate gambling, accept bets, process payments, manage outside accounts, issue payouts, or promise winnings.

## Current Site Direction

SlotsFreeUSA is a mobile-first adult information and entertainment site for:

- free slot-style demo play
- no-download slot guides
- social casino explainers
- sweepstakes casino education
- bonus-language guides
- safer-play education
- future ad and partner monetization after approval

The site must stay clear that it does not operate gambling, accept bets, process payments, manage outside accounts, issue payouts, or promise winnings.

Checks run:

- Read repo workflow and control files first.
- Confirmed the site purpose and current static HTML/CSS/JS stack.
- Confirmed every public HTML page has a title, meta description, canonical URL, H1, main navigation, and footer.
- Confirmed public sitemap entries correspond to existing public pages.
- Confirmed `robots.txt` exists, allows public crawl, blocks `/go/`, and points to the public sitemap.
- Checked internal `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, favicon, and SVG asset references used by public pages.
- Checked public contact copy and confirmed `slotsfreeusa@gmail.com` appears where contact is needed.
- Checked trust/legal pages: privacy, terms, affiliate disclosure, responsible play, how-we-review, partner inquiry, and contact pages.
- Checked for stale pending contact copy, unsupported winning claims, live ads, live affiliate links, tracking scripts, payment code, credentials, API keys, ordering integrations, and public AI.
- Confirmed monetization remains inactive and conditional until partner approval, disclosure, and tracking rules are confirmed.

Issues fixed:

## Files / Pages Complete

- No new SEO page is required from this audit pass.

- `sweepstakes-casino-guide.html`

## Known Blockers

- Local shell does not have `git` available, so this session used the GitHub connector for direct file commits.
- Browser/mobile visual QA is still pending and should use `VISUAL-QA-CHECKLIST.md`.
- Separate `css/search.css` creation was previously blocked by the connector safety filter. Search page styling remains inline.
- Actual affiliate application submission may require official portal login, affiliate account setup, business details, tax/payment details, or partner-manager approval.
- BetMGM application cannot be marked submitted until the official portal submission is completed.
- B2Spin / SpinBlitz cannot be marked contacted until the email is sent from `slotsfreeusa@gmail.com`.
- RSI / BetRivers cannot be marked contacted until the official contact form is submitted.
- Caesars remains blocked until an official verified affiliate path is found.

## Next Safe Queue

1. Run browser/mobile visual QA using `VISUAL-QA-CHECKLIST.md`.
2. Apply/register at BetMGM Partners through the official portal, then record the result in `AFFILIATE-SUBMISSION-LOG.md`.
3. Send B2Spin / SpinBlitz email from `slotsfreeusa@gmail.com`, then record the result.
4. Submit RSI / BetRivers contact form, then record the result.
5. Keep all monetization inactive until approval and disclosure checks are complete.
