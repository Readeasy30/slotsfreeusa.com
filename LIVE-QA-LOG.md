# SlotsFreeUSA Live QA Log

Last updated: 2026-05-28

Use this file to record live-site browser checks after deployment.

This log is separate from `VISUAL-QA-CHECKLIST.md`.

- `VISUAL-QA-CHECKLIST.md` explains what to check.
- `LIVE-QA-LOG.md` records what was actually checked and what happened.

## Current Status

Initial live browser check passed for the main domain and five checked pages.

The first live game check found that the Spin button was not working. The game script was patched twice: first to harden DOM-ready initialization, then to use a simpler delegated click handler and cache-busted script URL. Gerry retested and reported Spin fixed.

Reset also passed after the fix.

Search passed for `social`, `bonus`, and `slots`.

Trust/legal pages passed browser check. Repo-side static trust/legal check also passed for Contact, Privacy, Terms, Affiliate Disclosure, and Responsible Play.

Repo-side static layout sanity check passed for responsive menu, grid/card stacking, footer stacking, table overflow, full-width mobile buttons, and Classic Vegas slot page one-column behavior.

Repo-side mobile menu JavaScript check passed: menu toggles, `aria-expanded` updates, link taps close the menu, and Escape closes the menu.

Manual mobile and desktop browser layout checks remain pending before public promotion, affiliate follow-up, or monetization.

## Do Not Add During QA

Do not add:

- live affiliate links
- tracking links
- ad scripts
- payment tools
- email capture
- accounts
- public AI

QA should test the current public site only.

## Pass Criteria Before Promotion

Do not promote or follow up aggressively with partners until:

- Homepage loads cleanly on mobile and desktop.
- Free slot game works on mobile and desktop.
- Search works for basic terms.
- Footer and navigation are readable on mobile.
- Contact and partner pages are clear.
- Responsible-play, terms, privacy, and disclosure pages are reachable.
- No live monetization is accidentally active.

## Next Step

Run manual mobile and desktop layout QA using `VISUAL-QA-CHECKLIST.md`.
