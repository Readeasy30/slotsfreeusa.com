# SlotsFreeUSA Live QA Log

Last updated: 2026-05-28

Use this file to record live-site browser checks after deployment.

This log is separate from `VISUAL-QA-CHECKLIST.md`.

- `VISUAL-QA-CHECKLIST.md` explains what to check.
- `LIVE-QA-LOG.md` records what was actually checked and what happened.

## Current Status

Initial live browser check passed for the main domain and five checked pages.

The first live game check found that the Spin button was not working. The game script was patched twice: first to harden DOM-ready initialization, then to use a simpler delegated click handler and cache-busted script URL. Gerry retested and reported Spin fixed.

A fuller mobile, desktop, search, and trust-page QA pass is still required before public promotion, affiliate follow-up, or monetization.

## Do Not Add During QA

Do not add:

- live affiliate links
- tracking links
- ad scripts
- payment tools
- email capture
- accounts
- public AI

QA should test the current public site only.
